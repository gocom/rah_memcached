h1. rah_memcached

"Download":https://github.com/gocom/rah_memcached/releases | "Packagist":https://packagist.org/packages/rah/rah_memcached | "Issues":https://github.com/gocom/rah_memcached/issues

A plugin for "Textpattern CMS":https://textpattern.com that stores parts of your templates in "Memcached":https://memcached.org/, a distributed in-memory key-value caching system.

h2. Install

Using "Composer":https://getcomposer.org:

bc. $ composer require rah/rah_memcached

Or "download":https://github.com/gocom/rah_memcached/releases an installer package.

h2. Basics

The plugin, rah_memcached, introduces a new container tag to Textpattern's arsenal. The tag stores the wrapped content, and "variables":https://docs.textpattern.com/tags/variable set within it, in Memcached's in-memory storage.

bc. <rah::memcached>
    <txp:variable name="variable1" value="value" />
    <txp:article_custom limit="200">
        <txp:title />
    </txp:article_custom>
</rah::memcached>

On subsequent calls the resulting output markup and variables will be loaded from memory, skipping template parsing and code execution, speeding up your site and alleviating database load.

h2. Requirements

* Textpattern 4.7.0 or newer.
* PHP 7.1.0 or newer.
* "Memcached":https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php PHP extension.
* "libmemcached":https://libmemcached.org/ client library.
* "Memcached":https://memcached.org/ server.

h2. Configuration

Connected server can be configured through Textpattern's @textpattern/config.php@ file:

bc. define('RAH_MEMCACHED_HOST', 'localhost');
define('RAH_MEMCACHED_PORT', 11211);

h2. Attributes

bc. <rah::memcached>
    ...contained statement...
</rah::memcached>

The tag is a container and attributes for it follow.

*name*
Sets a name, a key, for the cached item. The given name is used identify the item, and save and fetch it from the storage. If a _name_ is not defined, it's automatically created by hashing the given contained markup. While the name is optional, giving it is more efficient and avoids any potential hash collisions.
Default: _undefined_ Example: @name="mykey"@

*expires*
Time in seconds it takes to the stored item to expire and be refreshed. If zero (@0@), the cache is kept in memory until the cache is flushed or Memcached is restarted.
Default: @0@ Example: @expires="3600"@

*persist*
If enabled, ignores content updates as set by site's @lastmod@ timestamp. By default, the cache is invalidated when Texptatern's lastmod timestamp is updated, which is done when any content is updated.
Default: _disabled_ Example: @persist@

h2. Examples

h3. Store section navigation in memory

bc. <rah::memcached name="navigation">
    <txp:section_list wraptag="ul" break="li">
        <txp:section />
    </txp:section_list>
</rah::memcached>

h3. Store variables in memory

bc.. <rah::memcached>
    <txp:variable name="color" value="red" />
    <txp:variable name="size" value="small" />
</rah::memcached>

Color: <txp:variable name="color" />
Size: <txp:variable name="size" />
